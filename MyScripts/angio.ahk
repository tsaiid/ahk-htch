HAIC (hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy) Catheter Readjustment

Clinical information: easily puncture wound oozing and occlusion of the infusion pump.

Operator: I-Ta Tsai
Anesthesia: local
Approach: left subclavian artery
Materials: 4F sheath, 4F J-curve

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:
- An existing HAIC catheter was noted with tip at the common hepatic duct.
- Its course from left subclavian to celiac trunk was smooth without kinking.
- The catheter was exchanged for a sheath using over-the-wire technique.
- A new catheter was placed with tip at the proper hepatic artery. The angiography showed well functioning.
- Abdominal straining and shoulder movement tests showed stability of the catheter.
- The connection point between sheath and catheter and the puncture site were covered with Tegaderm.
- The catheter was connected with normal saline pump for keeping patency.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Avoid vigorous movement of the limb with catheter.

- If any oozing from the puncture wound, please check any migration of catheter by KUB.
- Further embolization of the tumor with Lipiodol may be arranged after this HAIC session, according to clinical considerations.
- After HAIC session and removal of the catheter, the hemostasis of puncture wound should be securely achieved.

HAIC (hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy) Catheter Placement and Port Implantation

Operator: I-Ta Tsai, CC Chen
Anesthesia: local
Approach: right femoral artery
Devices: 5F Shuttle sheath, Perclose ProGlide Closure System
HAIC devices: Celsite port, Anthron P-U catheter.
Embolizer: Microcoils

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:
- Right femoral artery was approached under US guidance.
- Angiogram of celiac trunk was performed.
- The gastroduodenal artery and left gastric artery were embolized.
- A subcutaneous pocket was created at the right anterior thigh.
- The Perclose ProGlide system was applied.
- The Anthron P-U catheter was placed over the wire with tip in the proper hepatic artery.
- The port was connected to the catheter with a 2-cm subcutaneous tunnel tract, and was fixed in the pocket.
- The final angiography through the port confirmed its functionality, and 2000 IU/2 ml heparin was injected into the port.

- Initially, right femoral artery was approached under US guidance. The angiography of celiac trunk shows patent CHA, PHA, RHA, and LHA.
- The microcatheter could go forward to RHA and LHA 1st branch. However, the V-18 guide wire could not be steadily positioned, due to the acute angle of celiac trunk and tortuous CHA. Therefore, we shifted to right subclavian artery approach.
- With subclavian approach, the V-18 guide wire could be steadily positioned with tip in the LHA. However, the Anthron P-U catheter could only advanced to the PHA. In order to prevent the side hole being located in the aorta, the catheter tip was placed in the splenic artery, while the side hole at proximal CHA or celiac trunk.
- To reduce the splenic flow, a .018 14-6 Nester coil was deployed to the splenic artery, with partial coil residing in the P-U catheter.
- A small pocket was created at the right upper chest wall, where the port was fixed, and the catheter was connected to the port with a 2-cm subcutaneous tunnel tract. The wounds were closed with 3-0 Nylon.
- The final angiography through the port confirmed its functionality, and 2000 IU/2 ml heparin was injected into the port.

- Initially, right femoral artery was approached under US guidance. The angiography of celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery show a replaced LHA from LGA, communication between celiac and SMA with pancreaticoduodenal artery. Then, CTHA and CTAP were performed to determined the communications.
- These communications and the LGA were embolized with microcoils.
- No definite right gastroepiploic artery and right gastric artery is identified in the angiography.
- The Anthron P-U catheter was placed over the wire with tip in the common hepatic artery. (The tapered end was cut, because it could not reach deep enough for the side hole to be in the celiac trunk.)
- A small pocket was created at the RLQ of abdomen, where the port was fixed, and the catheter was connected to the port with a 2-cm subcutaneous tunnel tract. The wounds were closed with 3-0 Vicryl and Nylon.
- The final angiography through the port confirmed its functionality, and 2000 IU/2 ml heparin was injected into the port.

RECOMMENDATION:
- Avoid vigorous movement of the limb with catheter.
- Between each session of infusion therapy, the port should be heparinized.
- Periodically check the function of port by angiography.
- Wound care. Remove the sutures after the wounds heal.

OTHERS:

IMPRESSION:
A HAIC catheter was placed with tip at the CHA, and a port was implanted at the right anterior thigh.
